## **Exploration Data Analysis**

**Cell Line Analysis:**
+ Conducting Mann-Whitney analysis to find significant differences between ALT and Telomerase cell lines.
+ Performing hierarchical clustering using Spearman correlation.
  
**Clinical Line Analysis:**
+ Applying Mann-Whitney analysis to identify significant differences between ALT and Telomerase clinical samples.
+ Hierarchical clustering to visualize patterns.
  
**Integration Analysis:**
+ Exploring gene overlap between Clinical and Cell lines.
+ Hierarchical clustering for overlapped genes.
+ Integrating analysis with hMSC gene expression data.
  
**Correlation Analysis:**
+ Examining Spearman correlation among clinical, cell lines, hMSC, and normal samples.
+ Identifying potential correlations, especially involving ALT cells
