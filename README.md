Unravelling the Molecular Tapestry: A Gene Expression Signature Classifying Telomerase and ALT Immortalization

This GitHub repository contains the code and data files used in the analysis of gene expression patterns associated with ALT and telomerase immortalization. The project utilized data from the NCBI GEO database series [GSE14533](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14533) and explored the molecular landscape of immortalized cell lines and clinical samples.
